# timedQuiz

In this project I designed a simple multipe choice quiz with a timer element. For easy styling i used the bootstrap grid sytsem, as well as buttons and a navbar from the bootsrap library. 

I set up an objet array to house the 5 questions, and used the "click" event listener to maneuver through the quiz and to determine if the answer selected was correct or not.

Additional basic javascript components used are setInterval for the countdown clock, and local Storage to show prior user information of score and initials.

There is also some very basic css styling, including hiding and showing buttons at the proper times.
